# Open a text editor and create a new file called install-ubuntu-virtualbox.ps1.
# Copy and paste the following PowerShell script into the file: install-ubuntu-virtualbox.ps1
#Replace https://YOUR_UBUNTU_APPLIANCE_DOWNLOAD_URL with the direct download URL for the Ubuntu appliance in OVA format. You can get the URL from the official Ubuntu website or a trusted source. Also, replace YOUR_EXPECTED_SHA256_CHECKSUM with the correct SHA256 checksum for the downloaded file.
#Save the script and close the text editor.
#Run the script:
#Open a PowerShell terminal with administrative privileges.
#Navigate to the directory where you saved the script.
#Run the script with the command: .\install-ubuntu-virtualbox.ps1
#The script will download the Ubuntu appliance, calculate the SHA256 checksum, and compare it with the expected checksum. 
#If they match, the script will import the appliance into VirtualBox. If there's a mismatch, 
#the script will display an error message and won't import the appliance.
